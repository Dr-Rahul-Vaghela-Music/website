James is really worried about the recent situations at the workplace because he is having workplace crisis and in need of new crew member so puts up the advertisement in the ad agency! He is going through all the applications being filled up by people to find out to whom he can hire or buy contract for the company.
</div>
<br>
<div class=”block”>
    &#128526;&#127917;
(narrator - “This character is still the same as the last story but this time he is actually looking for new cast & he is still the director of the company but due to problems in daily lifestyle changes, he has no idea how to handle things digitally or what to do because he has so many pending things upcoming  but ceased by the virus.”)
</div>
<br>
<div class=”block”>
    &#128531;&#128391;
He is reading bio & stories from all of the new writers then got the one he liked a lot so called up & arranged the meeting at his house since production set was not a good idea to have chat or meeting for hiring a new cast & crews.
</div>
<br>
<div class=”block”>
    &#128533;&#9997;
(narrator -  “Writer included everyone who can help or assist or do any form of contribution to the new work they are planning for”)

James selected the guy who's name is Gabriel and writes screenplay and full documentaries but he actually sent him the fictional drama comedy which was not that great but way better than other applicants.
</div>
<br>
<div class=”block”>
    &#127381;
(narrator - “Gabriel is introducing him” )
</div>
<br>
<div class=”block”>

Meanwhile James got a call from his past casts & crews from intellectual humans!
</div>
<br>
<div class=”block”>
    &#128226;
(narrator – “James asking everyone how they are doing. Everyone was there except Jeff & Jennifer. They all had virtual meeting setup in conference so they wanted to see if James can turn on video of him hiring a new member as live feed so they all decided to keep that secret without telling the Gabriel”)
</div>
<br>
<div class=”block”>
James – “Hey, Where is your mask ?&#128528;”
</div>
<div class=”block”>
Gabriel – “No I did not write anything for that movie!&#128539;”

<div class=”block”>
Gabriel – “&#128559;Oh I see! I thought you are talking about that green mask movie ....you know that funny green man....&#128556;green mask...that's funny that we are talking about that but i think you don't look happy or laughing so i am putting on my regular mask so don't worry!&#128567;”
</div>
<br>
<div class=”block”>
&#128550;
(narrator - “ James is asking the guy if he wants anything to drink before they begin anything like purple juice, tea, coffee or perhaps lemonade ;) and going for tea in the kitchen by being sarcastic to him. Ellen is calling him to shutdown the video feed because she though watching this conversation without consent is not a good work ethics but James said ‘we already have mentioned those consent things in the forms so we can do anything and we are not bullying him this is just to get opinions from all of you how we should do for further’ Ellen is trying to talk but everybody is shouting at the back and having mask party!”)

</div>
<br>
<div class=”block”>

Gabriel - “ Inside the mind of the creator, he is visiting the show director to tell him the new story he wrote”
</div>
<br>
<div class=”block”>

He is watching no one is there so kept faith and walked like broken dreams and don't dream that its over! You can never find the home now those are the voices from the dark whispers.He did find one small store at the cross roads.When he went inside there was no human but humanoid man who looked like human but artificial reality.He still took the food & water for free as they had rules for human life emergency when they can take something for survival in the journey.Tragedy is not in the store.After finishing his meal he took he headed walking on road.There are three branches next to his destination and he has no idea in which way he should start walking!”

I am telling this because we are going to do something just to help you out in your life. You have to jump with me from the hill. Trust me this wont feel anything at all.”
